# Roguelike Dungeon Crawler

> Originally developed as a school group project for **COMP302**, this game has since been vastly expanded.  
> All major systems — **combat, health, boss battles, animations, sound design, map design, background art, superpowers, leveling and XP**, as well as the **armor and sword systems** — were designed and implemented by me.
